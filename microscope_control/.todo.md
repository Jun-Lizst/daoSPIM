## Burning
- [ ] Replace time.sleep() with a QTimer method to stop blocking threads
- [ ] make sure methods are thread-safe: image acquisition, image writing, live imaging
- [ ] add XY scanning and tiling
- [ ] add low-mag WF microscope on top

## Long-term
- [ ] separate GUI from core, use Qt Creator for new UI files
- [ ] make project structure more logical:
    - /devices
    - /gui
    - /utils (eg. image writer, gaussian fitters, optimizer)
    - /tests
